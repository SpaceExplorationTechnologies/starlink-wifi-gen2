	default n
	help
		By default, libfaad2 will be built to use fixed point rather
		than floating point math if emulated floating point operations
		are being used. (See the CONFIG_SOFT_FLOAT option.) Set this
		option if you would like to use floating point math regardless
		of whether floating point emulation is in use.
		
		For the best real-time decoding ability, leave this option off.
