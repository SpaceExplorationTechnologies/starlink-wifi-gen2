			Use the system's zlib library instead of rsync's internal copy. Enabling
			this may create compatibility errors when using compression  with older
			clients, or those using the current default of the bundled zlib.

			rsync's upstream default is to use their bundled zlib. OpenWrt uses the
			system zlib for space reasons. The system zlib will eventually become 
			default for upstream as well.
