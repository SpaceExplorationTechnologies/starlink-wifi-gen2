define Package/luci-app-cjdns/description
	This package allows you to configure and inspect cjdns networking using LuCI.

	Cjdns implements an encrypted IPv6 network using public-key cryptography
	for address allocation and a distributed hash table for routing.
	This provides near-zero-configuration networking, and prevents many
	of the security and scalability issues that plague existing networks.
