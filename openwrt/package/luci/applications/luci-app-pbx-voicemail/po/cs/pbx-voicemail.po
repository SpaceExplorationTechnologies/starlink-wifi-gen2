"Here you can configure a global voicemail for this PBX. Since this system is "
"intended to run on embedded systems like routers, there is no local storage "
"of voicemail - it must be sent out by email. Therefore you need to configure "
"an outgoing mail (SMTP) server (for example your ISP's, Google's, or Yahoo's "
"SMTP server), and provide a list of addresses that receive recorded "
"voicemail."
