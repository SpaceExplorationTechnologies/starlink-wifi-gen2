"If you experience jittery or high latency audio during heavy downloads, you "

"If you have more than one account that can make outgoing calls, you should "
"enter a list of phone numbers and/or prefixes in the following fields for "

"X, Z, N, #, *, and + are valid characters. The letter X matches 0-9, Z "
"matches 1-9, and N matches 2-9. For example to make calls to Germany through "
"a provider, you can enter 49. To make calls to North America, you can enter "
"1NXXNXXXXXX. If one of your providers can make \"local\" calls to an area "
"code like New York's 646, you can enter 646NXXXXXX for that provider. You "
"should leave one account with an empty list to make calls with it by "
"default, if no other provider's prefixes match. The system will "
"automatically replace an empty list with a message that the provider dials "
"all numbers not matched by another provider's prefixes. Be as specific as "
"possible (i.e. 1NXXNXXXXXX is better than 1). Please note all international "
"dial codes are discarded (e.g. 00, 011, 010, 0011). Entries can be made in a "
