Subject: [PATCH 03/17] bcm47xx-sprom: add Broadcom sprom parser driver

This driver needs an nvram driver and fetches the sprom values from the
nvram and provides it to any other driver. The calibration data for the
wifi chip the mac address and some more board description data is
stores in the sprom.

This is based on a copy of arch/mips/bcm47xx/sprom.c and my plan is to
make the bcm47xx MIPS SoCs also use this driver some time later.
